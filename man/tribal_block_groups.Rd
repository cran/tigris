\description{
From the US Census Bureau: "Tribal block groups are subdivisions of a tribal
census tract. Tribal block groups were defined by federally
recognized tribal government officials in the Census Bureau's
Tribal Statistical Areas Program (TSAP) for
the 2010 Census. If a tribal government declined to participate in TSAP, the Census Bureau delineated
tribal block groups on the American Indian reservation and/or off-reservation trust land (ORTL). Tribal
block groups are intended to generally contain between 600 and 3000 persons or between 240 and
1200 housing units. Many American Indian reservations and ORTLs have less than the minimum
population thresholds for more than one tribal block group and in those cases one tribal block group was
delineated that covers the entire American Indian reservation and/or ORTL. Unlike standard block
groups, the cluster of blocks that comprises each tribal block group will not necessarily begin with the
same first number of their 4-character census block number,
but may contain blocks from several different
standard census block groups."  For more information, please see the link provided.
