\description{
From the US Census Bureau (see link for source):
School Districts are single-purpose administrative units within which local officials provide public
educational services for the area's residents. The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries,
names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels biennially from state
education officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the
U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children in poverty within each
school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to
determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts.
}
\details{
The Census Bureau creates pseudo-unified school districts for areas in which unified school districts do
not exist.  Additionally, elementary and secondary school districts do not exist in all states.
Please see the link for more information on how the Census Bureau creates the school district shapefiles.
