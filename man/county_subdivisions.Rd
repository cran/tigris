Can also be a county name or vector of names.}

file.  Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed TIGER/Line file)}

\item{year}{the data year (defaults to 2017).}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to the underlying `load_tiger` function, which is not exported.
Options include \code{class}, which can be set to \code{"sp"} (the default) or \code{"sf"} to

\description{
From the US Census Bureau (see link for source, and more information): "County subdivisions
are the primary divisions of counties and their equivalent entities for the reporting of
decennial census data. They include census county divisions, census subareas, minor civil
divisions, and unorganized territories. They may represent legal or statistical entities.
The 2015 TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain a 5-character FIPS code field for county subdivisions
and an 8-character National Standards (GNIS) code."
