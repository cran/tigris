\title{Download an linear water shapefile into R}
\usage{
linear_water(state, county, year = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{The two-digit FIPS code of the state of the county you'd like to
download the water features for. Can also be state name or abbreviation
(case-insensitive).}

\item{county}{The three-digit FIPS code of the county you'd like the water
features for.  Can also be a county name.}

\item{year}{the data year (defaults to 2018).}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to the underlying `load_tiger` function, which is not exported.
Options include \code{class}, which can be set to \code{"sp"} (the default) or \code{"sf"} to
request sp or sf class objects, and \code{refresh}, which specifies whether or
not to re-download shapefiles (defaults to \code{FALSE}).).}

\description{
From the US Census Bureau: "The linear hydrography shapefile contains all linear
features with "H" (Hydrography) type MTFCCs in the
MAF/TIGER database by county. The shapefiles are provided at a county geographic extent and in linear
elemental feature geometry. The linear hydrography shapefile includes streams/rivers, braided streams,
canals, ditches, artificial paths, and aqueducts. A linear hydrography feature may include edges with both
perennial and intermittent persistence."
