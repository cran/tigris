cartographic boundary file.  Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed
TIGER/Line file).}

\item{detailed}{(deprecated) Setting detailed to FALSE returns a 1:500k cartographic boundary file.
This parameter will be removed in a future release.}

\item{...}{arguments to be passed to the underlying `load_tiger` function, which is not exported.

\description{
This function allows you to download boundaries for state legislatures into R.
Generally, state legislatures are comprised of an "upper" house, which is
typically referred to as the Senate, and a "lower" house, which is often (but
not exclusively) referred to as the House.  The exception is Nebraska, which
has a unicameral state legislature.
