\description{
Description from the US Census Bureau (see link for source):
The 2017 TIGER/Line Shapefiles contain the 115th Congressional Districts. All congressional districts
appearing in the 2017 TIGER/Line Shapefiles reflect the information provided to the Census Bureau by
the states by May 1, 2016. The 115th Congressional District shapefile contains the areas in effect from
January 2017 to 2019.
}
\details{
Congressional districts are the 435 areas from which people are elected to the U.S. House of
Representatives and the five areas with nonvoting delegates from state equivalents. After the
apportionment of congressional seats among the states based on decennial census population counts,
each state is responsible for establishing the boundaries of the congressional districts for the purpose of
electing representatives. Each congressional district is to be as equal in population to all other
congressional districts in a state as practicable.
