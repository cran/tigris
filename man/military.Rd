Description from the US Census Bureau: "The Census Bureau includes landmarks
such as military installations in the MAF/TIGER database for
locating special features and to help enumerators during field operations. The Census Bureau adds
landmark features to the database on an as-needed basis and does not attempt to ensure that all
instances of a particular feature are included. For additional information about area landmarks, please
see Section 3.12, Landmarks (Area and Point)."
}
\details{
This file does not include the three point landmarks identified as military installation features in the
MAF/TIGER database. These point landmarks are included in the point landmark shapefile.
Although almost all military installations have assigned 8-character National Standard (GNIS) codes, the
Census Bureau has not loaded most of this data into the MAF/TIGER database. The 2014 military
shapefiles contain few values in the ANSICODE field.
