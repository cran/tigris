Download and use Census TIGER/Line shapefiles in R

CRAN version: __0.2.2__ (updated 15 February 2016)

Dev version: __0.3.0.9000__ (updated 16 May 2016)

`tigris` is an R package that allows users to directly download and use TIGER/Line shapefiles (<https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html>) from the US Census Bureau.  

To install the package from CRAN, issue the following command in R: 

```
install.packages('tigris')
```

Or, get the development version from GitHub: 

```
devtools::install_github('walkerke/tigris')
```

__Basic usage:__

```r
library(tigris)

# Basic plot of US urbanized areas

ua <- urban_areas(cb = TRUE)

plot(ua)

```

```r
# Interactive Leaflet map (requires the leaflet R package)

library(leaflet)

ua %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addPolygons(popup = ~NAME10)

```

__In Version 0.3__: 

* tigris now defaults to the 2015 TIGER/Line shapefiles and the 2015 cartographic boundary shapefiles (with `cb = TRUE` for selected functions).  

* The `refresh` option can now be used to fix corrupted downloads.  If you receive the error: 

```
Error in ogrInfo(dsn = dsn, layer = layer, encoding = encoding, use_iconv = use_iconv,  : 
  Cannot open layer 
```

call the function again, but with the argument `refresh = TRUE`, which will re-download the shapefile.  


__In Version 0.2.2__:

* New function, `voting_districts()`, enables users to retrieve voting district (electoral precinct) shapefiles from the 2012 TIGER/Line dataset.

* tigris now imports and re-exports the `plot()` function from the sp package so that Census shapefiles can be plotted without having to load sp explicitly.

__In Version 0.2__:

* Enhancements to the `geo_join` function to merge tabular data frames to spatial data frames.  An optional parameter, `by`, allows you to supply one column name to merge on if the column names are the same.  For example: 
```r
joined_data <- geo_join(spatial_data, data_frame, by = 'common_column')
```
* `geo_join` also accommodates inner joins as well.  By supplying `'inner`' to the new `how` parameter, the resultant spatial data frame will retain only those rows that match the target tabular data frame.  For example: 
```r
library(rnaturalearth)
library(WDI)
library(tigris)

dat <- WDI(country = "all",
           indicator = "SP.DYN.LE00.IN",
           start = 2012,
           end = 2012)

dat$SP.DYN.LE00.IN <- round(dat$SP.DYN.LE00.IN, 1)

countries <- ne_countries()

countries2 <- geo_join(countries, dat, 'iso_a2', 'iso2c', how = 'inner')
```

__In Version 0.1:__

* The `detailed` parameter is now deprecated; replace it with `cb = TRUE` to get cartographic boundary files.  When applicable, this allows users to get very-generalized cartographic boundary files by supplying `5m` or `20m` to the `resolution` parameter.  
* There is much more documentation available!  Keep an eye out, we hope to have the package on CRAN soon.  

__In Version 0.0.8__: 

* `tigris` now caches shapefile downloads!  Download the file once, and `tigris` will store the downloaded shapefile in a special directory so you don't have to re-download every time.  To turn off this behavior, change the option with `options(tigris_use_cache = FALSE)`.  
* `tigris` is also now much smarter when handling geography arguments.  For example, `tracts("TX", "Dallas")` will get you Census tracts for Dallas County, TX without having to know the FIPS code.  
* You can combine multiple `tigris` objects of the same type with the new `rbind_tigris` function
* Multiple years are now supported!  `tigris` defaults to 2014, but you can change years with the new `tigris_year` option.  For example, specifying `options(tigris_year = 2015)` will tell `tigris` to download the new 2015 TIGER/Line files in your R session.  A caution: not everything is available in every year; for example, generalized cartographic boundary files are not released for 2015 yet, so the `detailed = FALSE` argument won't work.  
* There is much more - download the package and try it out!

__Version 0.0.5 release highlights:__

* Many new geographies are available for download - state legislative districts, urbanized areas, Native American areas, and lots more!
* For many geographies (e.g. states, counties, Census tracts, etc.) an optional argument, `detailed = FALSE`, can be supplied to download simplified (smaller) shapefiles.  While not recommended for analysis, their smaller size makes them better for mapping.  
* A new function, `lookup_code`, allows you to look up FIPS codes for states and counties interactively.  
* Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) have an optional parameter, `starts_with`, that allows you to supply an argument to return only those ZCTAs that begin with that string
