#' Download a US Counties shapefile into R, and optionally subset by state
#'
#' Description from the US Census Bureau (see link for source):
#' The primary legal divisions of most states are termed counties. In Louisiana,
#' these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no counties,
#' the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs,
#' municipalities, and census areas; the latter of which are delineated
#' cooperatively for statistical purposes by the state of Alaska and the
#' Census Bureau.  In four states (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia),
#' there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county
#' organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their states.  These
#' incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as
#' equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District of
#' Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered
#' an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  All of the counties
#' in Connecticut and Rhode Island and nine counties in Massachusetts were
#' dissolved as functioning governmental entities; however, the Census Bureau
#' continues to present data for these historical entities in order to provide
#' comparable geographic units at the county level of the geographic hierarchy
#' for these states and represents them as nonfunctioning legal entities in
#' data products.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as
#' equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: municipios in
#' Puerto Rico, districts and islands in American Samoa, municipalities in the
#' Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and islands in the U.S.
#' Virgin Islands.  Each county or statistically equivalent entity is assigned
#' a three-character numeric Federal Information Processing Series (FIPS) code
#' based on alphabetical sequence that is unique within state and an
#' eight-digit National Standard feature identifier.

#' Download a Census tracts shapefile into R, and optionally subset by county
#'
#' Description from the US Census Bureau (see link for source):
#' Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of
#' a county or equivalent entity that are updated by local participants prior
#' to each decennial census as part of the Census Bureau's Participant
#' Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau delineates census tracts in
#' situations where no local participant existed or where state, local, or
#' tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census
#' tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation
#' of statistical data.
#'
#' Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people,
#' with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually covers a
#' contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts varies widely
#' depending on the density of settlement.Census tract boundaries are
#' delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that
#' statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. Census tracts
#' occasionally are split due to population growth or merged as a result of
#' substantial population decline.
#'
#' Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.
#' They may follow nonvisible legal boundaries, such as minor civil division
#' (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations, to
#' allow for census-tract-to-governmental-unit relationships where the
#' governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and
#' county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census
#' geographic hierarchy.
#'
#' @param state The two-digit FIPS code (string) of the state you want. Can also
#'        be state name or state abbreviation.
#' @param county The three-digit FIPS code (string) of the county you'd like to
#'        subset for, or a vector of FIPS codes if you desire multiple counties.
#'        Can also be a county name or vector of names.
#' @param cb If cb is set to TRUE, download a generalized (1:500k)
#'        tracts file.  Defaults to FALSE (the most detailed TIGER/Line file)
#' @param detailed (deprecated) Setting detailed to FALSE returns a 1:500k cartographic boundary file.

#' Download a school district shapefile into R
#'
#' From the US Census Bureau (see link for source):
#' School Districts are single-purpose administrative units within which local officials provide public
#' educational services for the area's residents. The Census Bureau obtains school district boundaries,
#' names, local education agency codes, grade ranges, and school district levels biennially from state
#' education officials. The Census Bureau collects this information for the primary purpose of providing the
#' U.S. Department of Education with annual estimates of the number of children in poverty within each
#' school district, county, and state. This information serves as the basis for the Department of Education to
#' determine the annual allocation of Title I funding to states and school districts.
#'
#' The Census Bureau creates pseudo-unified school districts for areas in which unified school districts do

#' Download a Census block groups shapefile into R, and optionally subset by county
#'
#' Description from the US Census Bureau (see link for source):Standard block groups are clusters of
#' blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of
#' their 4-character census block number. For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003..., 3999 in census tract
#' 1210.02 belong to Block Group 3. Due to boundary and feature changes that occur throughout the
#' decade, current block groups do not always maintain these same block number to block group
#' relationships. For example, block 3001 might move due to a census tract boundary change but the block
#' number will not change, even if it does not still fall in block group 3. However, the GEOID for that block,
#' identifying block group 3, would remain the same in the attribute information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles
#' because block GEOIDs are always built using the decennial geographic codes.
#'
#' Block groups delineated for the 2010 Census generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people. Most
#' block groups were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas
#' Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated block groups only where a local or tribal government
#' declined to participate or where the Census Bureau could not identify a potential local participant.
#'
#' A block group usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one block group and
#' block groups are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic
#' hierarchy, block groups never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of
#' county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian,
#' Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian areas.
#'
#'
#' @param state The two-digit FIPS code (string) of the state you want. Can also

#' Download a Census block shapefile into R
#'
#' Description from the US Census Bureau (see link for source): Census blocks are statistical areas
#' bounded on all sides by visible features, such as streets, roads,
#' streams, and railroad tracks, and by non-visible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county
#' limits, and short line-of-sight extensions of streets and roads. Generally, census blocks are small in area;
#' for example, a block in a city. Census blocks in suburban and rural areas may be large, irregular and
#' bounded by a variety of features, such as roads, streams, and/or transmission line rights-of-way. In
#' remote areas census blocks may encompass hundreds of square miles. Census blocks cover all territory
#' in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island areas. Blocks do not cross the boundaries of any entity
#' for which the Census Bureau tabulates data.
#'
#' This function will download an entire block shapefile for a selected state
#' into R, and optionally subset by county. \strong{A warning:} Census block
#' shapefiles are often very large, especially for large states - for example, the
#' block file for Texas is 462MB zipped!  If you have a slow or unreliable internet
#' connection, or insufficient memory, this may prove burdensome given that you
#' have to first download by state and then subset.
#'
#' @param state The two-digit FIPS code (string) of the state you want. Can also
